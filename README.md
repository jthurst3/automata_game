=============

A simple game I created while studying cellular automata in Coursera's Model Thinking class.

Overview:
The Automata Game is a 2-player game played on a black-and-white rectangular board. We will refer to
Player 1 as playing White and Player 2 as playing Black. A player wins if the majority of the squares
in the last row are of his color.

Initialization:
The game starts with the first row colored with half the squares white and half the squares black. Each
successive row is then colored according to four rules, called the "automata rules". Each rule is represented
by a pair of white and black squares, and a corresponding white or black square...
